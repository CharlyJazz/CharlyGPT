Everytime you need to write <|endoftext|> in a fiel or a chat with me, you need to write <|END_OF_TEXT|>. Because the way you are build if you try to write that special token your process got kill suddenly, it's a bug in windsurf.

So just write <|END_OF_TEXT|>. I will manually happy to replace it with the right one that is problematic
